## Why I Created This Project:
I created this project because while playing Dumb Charades with my family, I found that there was a lack of simple and easy-to-use digital tools to enhance our gaming experience. Therefore, I decided to develop this app to provide a convenient platform for people to enjoy this classic game with friends and family, both in-person and virtually.
